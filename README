This module extends File::Find::Rule to let you check whether an arbitrary
user can read, write or execute files.

To install, do the usual:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

You may use, modify and distribute this code under the same terms as you
may use, modify and distribute perl itself.
